# Contact Managment Application 

Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router and Flux.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Create, Update, Delete and Read contacts. [Check it out here!](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

***Please use the Flux architecture for this:*** The Flux architecture is one of the most used proposal for web application architetures.

## 🌱  How to start this project

1. This project comes with the necessary files to start working, but you have two options to start:

a) Open this link in your browser to clone it with gitpod (recommended): https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list.git

b) You can clone this repository on your local computer:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list.git
```

2. Install the dependencies using `$ npm install`

3. Run the project `$ npm run start`

💡 Important: Remember to create a new repository, update the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and upload the code to your new repository using `add`, `commit` and `push`.


### The project is divided in: 

#### Two different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form that you can use to create or update contatcs.

#### There is one additional component:
ContactCard: Ideal component to display just one contact.

## Expected functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application create, edit, 
and delete contacts from the list.
- (Optional but is a plus) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the 
Modal component for that.





That is it! Start coding your ReactJS + Flux application.
